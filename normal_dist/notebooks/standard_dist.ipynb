    "# Probability Distributions\n",
    "Many standard statistical models operate under the assumption that your dataset takes on a certain distribution, such a Gaussian (normal). The probability distribution describes the array of all possible outcomes that a random variable can take, along with the probability of each possibility. Depending on the random variable and the situation, a number of different distributions are possible. \n",

    "## Discrete vs Continuous Random Variables\n",
    "Let's say we blindly pick a random variable X from our dataset. The possible values for X can be described as discrete if X can only take on a certain number of distinct values, such as in a coin flip where X can only equal heads or tails, and continuous if X can take on an infinite number of possible values, such as weight or height. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Discrete Variables\n",
    "If X is discrete and can only take on a limited set of values, then we can calculate the probility that X is either heads or tails, called it's **probability mass function**. Examples of these types of distributions are Bernoulli, Binomial and Poisson. \n",

    "- `P(X) = 1/2`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuous Variables\n",
    "For a continuous X, the probability that X can belong to any particular range of values is known as it's **probability density function**. Rather than trying to determine the probability that X is equal to a specific value, we are interested in the probability that X falls in the range of real numbers. \n",
    "- `continuous_X = ∞`  \n",
    "- `P(X=x) = 0` Because X can take on any, or all, real values \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though we cannot calculate the probability that X equals a particular random number, we can calculate the probability that a value, k, lies within the range of X, by calculating the probability density function for X, and determining if k falls in the area under the curve. \n",
